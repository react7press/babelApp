The knee is an intricate joint, involving bones, menisci, muscles, tendons, and ligaments all supporting the joint. If there is damage or stress to any of these components, you may have achy knees.</p><p>Plus, many physical activities&mdash;running, jumping, stretching, bending&mdash;can put a lot of strain, impact, or body weight directly on the knees, and in turn, cause pain while you work out. This is common among weekend warriors who work out intensely but inconsistently.</p><p>You can also develop tendonitis over time if you&rsquo;re regularly doing these motions.</p>', 3, '1', '2018-03-02 09:01:29', 'post_1519977690.jpg', '1'),

However, only about half of American adults actually meet those recommendations, and for older adults, they may seem hard to achieve. But a new report published in the British Journal of Sports Medicine suggests that there&rsquo;s a way to tweak guidelines to make them more feasible for older people, while still maintaining health.</p><p>In the report, researchers looked at about 1,180 men &mdash; average age, 78 &mdash; who agreed to wear devices that measured their movements for seven days. They were followed for about five years. The researchers found that the overall volume of exercise, not necessarily how long or how hard someone exercised in a session, mattered most for longevity.</p>', 4, '0', '2018-03-02 09:03:50', 'post_1519977831.jpg', '1'),

And while lots of times &ldquo;core&rdquo; and &ldquo;abs&rdquo; become synonymous, it&rsquo;s not 100% correct to use them interchangeably. Your rectus abdominus, transverse abdominus and obliques do comprise your midsection, but those aren&rsquo;t the only muscles involved. Your back, hips and glutes also provide that stable base you need for stepping forward and backward, jumping side-to-side or turning all about. So to get a serious core workout you need to work them all.</p><p>&ldquo;Core strength and stability not only enhances physical and athletic performance, but also helps maintain and correct posture and form, and prevent injury,&rdquo; says Andia Winslow, a Daily Burn Audio Workouts trainer. &ldquo;Those who have an awareness of their core and ability to engage it properly also have enhanced proprioception &mdash; or a sense of the positions of their extremities, without actually seeing them.&rdquo;</p>', 4, '0', '2018-03-02 09:06:25', 'post_1519977985.jpg', '1');
